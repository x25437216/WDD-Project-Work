					<p class="textAC">Ireland's coastline of around 7,500km is, according to cso.ie, "provided exceptionally good seafood for thousands of years." This is both a good and bad thing simultaniously, as our waters can be used to make local food, which then can be used to feed people. However, some fisheries in Ireland end up overfishing (that is, excessively fishing to the point of taking more fish out of the water than they can reproduce), which can easily lead to the extinction of certain fish that are native to Ireland. The impacts that this possibility can lead us to is why strict precautions are taken to lessen the impact of the Food Industry itself.</p>

					<p class="textAC">Overfishing isn't the only impact on Life under water. One of the biggest impacts on Life Under Water is the amount of pollution that exists. Recyclible stuff such as plastic, cardboard and polystyrene are ending up in the ocean, which pollutes it and as a consenquence, makes it much harder for any form of life to live underwater. Another such impact of pollution is the destruction of underwater ecosystems such as coral reef's and kelp forrests to name two. These underwater ecosystems are at constant risk of being destorying, some more than others. Plastics and polystyrene are much more oftenly seen in public than before due to concerns with climate change, which unfortunatley can cause more pollution in the ocean if these places and companies aren't careful enough.</p>

					<p class="textAC">Even the types of fisheries in Ireland are making an impact to the life underneath the surface, however big or small these fisheries may be. From the local fisheries who do it out of  family tradition to companies who want to make a porfitable but sustainable business, their footprints, and what they do with said footprint, will make a difference. This is why <a href="https://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-sdg14/irelandsunsdgs-goal14lifebelowwater2021/overview-lifebelowwaterinireland/">CSO</a> plays an important role in life underwater, as without any of their regulation, we would've lost not only a load of biodiverisy, but also a lot of species in our oceans as well.</p>

					<p class="textAC">The Global Goals website provides you with a really good base for what you, as well as others, can do to help sustain life under water and to preserve it for future generations. In relation to the food industry, one of the big points to keep in mind with this is to be sustainable with fishing, i.e being sure to not overfish and ensure no illegal practices, like unregulated and destructive fishing, happens. By following these targets, it will allow many species of fish to restore their own stocks and help their own species grow.</p>

					<p class="textAC">Some more general things that people can do to help is to avoid buying any kinds of bottled water, which also goes hand in hand with reducing the waste produced on land itself. Global Goals states that "usage and wrong disposal of plastic is a major cause of marine pollution", and by being more mindful about this, it will also help marine life in the ocean. Additionally, people can organize cleanups for rivers and oceans that are near to them. With the help of their local community, there can be a lot of waste removed from oceans. Supporting smaller fishers (that arent promoting bad fishing values) are also recommended.</p>

					<p class="textAC">Another big aim that the Global Goals outline is the protection and restorations of ecosystems around the world. Ecosystems like coral reefs and kelp forests are helping to make life under water sustainable, however due to the aforementioned reasons, these precious ecosystems are often at risk of disappearing at an alarming rate. If everyone did a little bit of what was mentioned above (that is, ~8 billion people all doing something small), these issues would've possibly been either mostly erased or fully solved by now, which is why taking any sort of action, be it big or small, matters to the ocean.</p>

					<p class="textAC">On Global Goals, most aims for the future were either expired and need updating (dates by 2020), or are about to expire (dates by 2025). However, one is currently still ongoing for 5 more years, and that would be to increase "the economicfrom sustainable use of marine sources". The ides is, by then, to have increased economic benefits by sustainably using the marine resources available to us to help any small islands that're currently developing states, or helping lesser developed countries. Another goal is to to help provide greater access to "marine resources and markets" for the small fishers, according to the "UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, SDG 14.b </p>

					<p class="textAC">CSO have more updated aims, having agreed to the "North-East Atlantic Enviroment Strategy (NEAES 20230)" back in October of 2021. This is currently in operation until 2030, as the name suggests, and has 12 streategic objectives, all of them aided by the help of 54 objectives. There's four main goals outlined that they aim to achieve, those being cleaner seas, more biolegically diverse and healthier seas, more productive and better sustained seas and a more resilant sea to climate change. In the progress report, published in 2025, over 50% of tasks are currently on track to be completed by 2030, with only 4% needing better attention to be reached, and 19% of tasks already being completed. This progress report also aded 20 more tasks to help push the "Implementation Plan" further.</p>

					<p class="textAC">There's many other goals that are left out there, but I'll go other just a few, the rest can be found over on the <a href="https://www.ospar.org/convention/strategy">OSPAR website.</a> By setting a limit on the Total Allowable Catches amount and having quotas for Maximun Sustainable Yield, the CSO follows SDG 14.4, implementing "science based managment plans." Finally, by expanding disciplines on fisheries via prohibiting fisheries contributing to overfishing and overcapacity & removing those contributing to Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing, these goals all aim for a cleaner and safer ocean for our species, our biodiversity, and our lifes as a whole.</p>
