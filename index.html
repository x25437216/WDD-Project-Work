					<p class="textAC">Ireland's coastline of around 7,500km is, according to cso.ie, "provided exceptionally good seafood for thousands of years." This is both a good and bad thing simultaniously, as our waters can be used to make local food, which then can be used to feed people. However, some fisheries in Ireland end up overfishing (that is, excessively fishing to the point of taking more fish out of the water than they can reproduce), which can easily lead to the extinction of certain fish that are native to Ireland. The impacts that this possibility can lead us to is why strict precautions are taken to lessen the impact of the Food Industry itself.</p>

					<p class="textAC">Overfishing isn't the only impact on Life under water. One of the biggest impacts on Life Under Water is the amount of pollution that exists. Recyclible stuff such as plastic, cardboard and polystyrene are ending up in the ocean, which pollutes it and as a consenquence, makes it much harder for any form of life to live underwater. Another such impact of pollution is the destruction of underwater ecosystems such as coral reef's and kelp forrests to name two. These underwater ecosystems are at constant risk of being destorying, some more than others. Plastics and polystyrene are much more oftenly seen in public than before due to concerns with climate change, which unfortunatley can cause more pollution in the ocean if these places and companies aren't careful enough.</p>

					<p class="textAC">Even the types of fisheries in Ireland are making an impact to the life underneath the surface, however big or small these fisheries may be. From the local fisheries who do it out of  family tradition to companies who want to make a porfitable but sustainable business, their footprints, and what they do with said footprint, will make a difference. This is why <a href="https://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-sdg14/irelandsunsdgs-goal14lifebelowwater2021/overview-lifebelowwaterinireland/">CSO</a> plays an important role in life underwater, as without any of their regulation, we would've lost not only a load of biodiverisy, but also a lot of species in our oceans as well.</p>

We have felt the ground shake and the air shattered by the testing of a Saturn C-1 booster rocket, many times as powerful as the Atlas which launched John Glenn, generating power equivalent to 10,000 automobiles with their accelerators on the floor. We have seen the site where the F-1 rocket engines, each one as powerful as all eight engines of the Saturn combined, will be clustered together to make the advanced Saturn missile, assembled in a new building to be built at Cape Canaveral as tall as a 48 story structure, as wide as a city block, and as long as two lengths of this field.</p>
